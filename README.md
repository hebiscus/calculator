# Odin Project - Calculator
Tools used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

What I learned during this project: perfected DOM manipulation skills along with more complicated logic needed to display and operate on proper numbers
# Live preview:

# What could be improved:
- numbers not overflowing the display
- displaying currently chosen operator (+ - * / )
- backspace or delete button to erase last inputed number into the display
- decimals button
